# Project Name

Server Side Calculator

## Description

This project creates a calculator that takes two user inputs and an operator of the user's choice - addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division- to calculate an equation.  The client stores the user data in an object and post's it to the server.  The server then makes all the calculations based on the user data and stores the equation and answer in an array on the server.  The client gets that answer and equation from the server and displays the answer to the current equation as well as displays the entire history of the user's inputs and answers.
